# Image Board Browser

This project is the iOS client of Japanese anime image board site including: 

1. konachan.com
2. yande.re

# Main features

1. Browse latest images
2. Request large sample or original jpeg file
3. Add favourite image to favourite collection
4. Search image by tags
5. Quick search images with one of the same tag of the current browsing image
6. Save image to photos
7. ~~Swipe to switch tabs~~
8. Safe Mode switch. As those image sources may contain R18 content, I provided a filter switch. The main purpose for this app is to demonstrate some of my plugins and for practising, rather than spreading questionable contents. As the default settings, the explicit contents will be blocked. **DO NOT SWITCH IT OFF BEFORE YOU UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES AND USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISKS!!**
9. Add/remove and quick search favourite tags
